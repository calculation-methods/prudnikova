   abstract = {A new algorithm for the volume tracking of interfaces in two dimensions is presented. The algorithm is based upon a well-defined, second-order geometric solution of a volume evolution equation. The method utilizes local discrete material volume and velocity data to track interfaces of arbitrarily complex topology. A linearity-preserving, piecewise linear interface geometry approximation ensures that solutions generated retain second-order spatial accuracy. Second-order temporal accuracy is achieved by virtue of a multidimensional unsplit time integration scheme. We detail our geometrically based solution method, in which material volume fluxes are computed systematically with a set of simple geometric tasks. We then interrogate the method by testing its ability to track interfaces through large, controlled topology changes, whereby an initially simple interface configuration is subjected to vortical flows. Numerical results for these strenuous test problems provide evidence for the algorithm's improved solution quality and accuracy.},

   abstract = {Several methods have been previously used to approximate free boundaries in finite-difference numerical simulations. A simple, but powerful, method is described that is based on the concept of a fractional volume of fluid (VOF). This method is shown to be more flexible and efficient than other methods for treating complicated free boundary configurations. To illustrate the method, a description is given for an incompressible hydrodynamics code, SOLA-VOF, that uses the VOF technique to track free fluid surfaces.},

   abstract = {Abstract A new algorithm for volume tracking which is based on the concept of flux-corrected transport (FCT) is introduced. It is applicable to incompressible 2D flow simulations on finite volume and difference meshes. The method requires no explicit interface reconstruction, is direction-split and can be extended to 3D and orthogonal curvilinear meshes in a straightforward manner. A comparison of the new scheme against well-known existing 2D finite volume techniques is undertaken. A series of progressively more difficult advection tests is used to test the accuracy of each scheme and it is seen that simple advection tests are inadequate indicators of the performance of volume-tracking methods. A straightforward methodology is presented that allows more rigorous estimates to be made of the error in volume advection and coupled volume and momentum advection in real flow situations. The volume advection schemes are put to a final test in the case of Rayleigh–Taylor instability. © 1997 by CSIRO.},
